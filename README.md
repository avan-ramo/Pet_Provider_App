# Pet_Provider_App


This application is to find people to take care of your pets and to also provide that option
as a pet care taker. What sets this application apart from apps like Rover is that it is not
just limited to cats and dogs. Users can also be matched on smaller pets such as pond fish,
aquarium animals, exotic animals, and farm animals. Users are matched based on their criteria
through a list of providers/requesters that match their criteria. They can be viewed either
as a list form or map and filtered according to different criteria such as proximity, price, and
ratings.
